# Private Candle 

#### Create disconnected spaces to enjoy sourrounding people. 


## Why? 
###### I live most of my time connected. It is The first thing I do when I wake up, and the last too. Event if I am not behind a terminal, I am still available if someone wants to communicate with me. I sometimes answer professional e-mails at 1am or 2am. 
###### But I am not the only one to do that and that's the real problem. Since the smartphones came in our lives, the society started to change deeply. All waiting rooms, or wainting spaces in general,  are field of smartphones.
