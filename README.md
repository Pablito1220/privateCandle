## Why? 
###### I live most of my time connected. It is the first thing I do when I wake up, and the last too. Event if I am not behind a terminal, I am still available if someone wants to communicate with me. I sometimes answer professional e-mails at 1am or 2am. 
###### But I am not the only one to do that and that's the real problem. Since the smartphones came in our lives, the society started to change deeply. All waiting rooms, or wainting spaces in general, are filled with people staring at their smartphones. Some new physical, mental or social symptoms appeared, like *FOMO*, *blurring* or **post-truth**. 

## How?
###### We must reunite with our physicality and momentary stop our digital presence. That is why I designed a candlestick that scrambles the network when you light the candle on. This object was made with standards electronic pieces and 3d prints which makes its construction accessible to any maker.
